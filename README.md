# AlbopictusDiapause_RNAseq

Multiple projects and publications have been completed and generated understanding expression difference of diapause and non-diapause at multiple timepoints during the Aedes albopictus lifecycle. However, now a better quality reference assembly exist and old data needs to be reanalyzed based on this reference. We will re-analyze the various diapause transcriptomes. Potentially, once all analyses are done against common refence, we may also look for clusters of genes that change across timepoints in a coordinated way.
